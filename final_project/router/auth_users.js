Task 7:

    Complete the code for logging in as a registered user.

Hint: The code must validate and sign in a customer based on the username and password created in Exercise 6. It must also save the user credentials for the session as a JWT.
As you are required to login as a customer, while testing the output on Postman, use the endpoint as "customer/login"

    Test the output on Postman.

    Please take a screenshot of the same and save it with the name 7-login.png for submitting under Task 7 for the Peer Review Assignment.

Task 8:

    Complete the code for adding or modifying a book review.

Hint: You have to give a review as a request query & it must get posted with the username (stored in the session) posted. If the same user posts a different review on the same ISBN, it should modify the existing review. If another user logs in and posts a review on the same ISBN, it will get added as a different review under the same ISBN.

    Test the output on Postman.

    Please take a screenshot of the same and save it with the name 8-reviewadded.png for submitting under Task 8 for the Peer Review Assignment.

Task 9:

Complete the code for deleting a book review under regd_users.delete("/auth/review/:isbn", (req, res) => {

Hint: Filter & delete the reviews based on the session username, so that a user can delete only his/her reviews and not other usersâ€™.

    Test the output on Postman.

    Please take a screenshot of the same and save it with the name 9-deletereview.png for submitting under Task 9 for the Peer Review Assignment.
